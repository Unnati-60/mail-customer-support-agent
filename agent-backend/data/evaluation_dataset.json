It has been showing “in transit – arriving soon” for two full days now. Considering the price and importance of this purchase, this delay is stressing me out because I urgently need the laptop for remote office work starting next week.\n\nCould you please check the exact delivery status with the courier and let me know whether it is delayed or on schedule? If possible, please share the expected delivery timeline so I can plan accordingly.\n\nOrder was placed on 7th February under my account (Rohan Mehta).\nHoping for a quick response.\nRegards,\nRohan",

I’m considering buying a laptop from your store this month, but before I order I want to know something clearly: if I am not satisfied with the performance or I simply find that it doesn’t suit my workload, can I return it within a certain period?\n\nSome stores allow returns only for defects and not for preference-based dissatisfaction. Could you please confirm how your return window works, especially for high-value products like laptops? And whether refunds are initiated to the original payment method or only store credits?\n\nThanks in advance,\nPriya",

The payment went through instantly via Google Pay (UPI) and my bank confirmed the deduction. However, on my orders page it still shows “payment pending” and “waiting for confirmation.” I’m unsure if the order is valid and I do NOT want to reorder and get charged twice.\n\nCan you please check your system and confirm whether the payment is successful and whether the order is valid? If there’s an issue, should I reorder or wait? I have screenshots if needed.\n\nRegards,\nSneha",
